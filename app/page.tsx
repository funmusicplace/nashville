Three Mirlo artists have been invited to present at Americanafest, the annual gathering of the Americana Music 
Association that takes place in Nashville, Tennessee. The panel is called 
Music Cooperatives: Reshaping the Industry Through Solidarity, Not 
Exploitation and will feature four panelists:

*[Alex Rodr√≠guez](https://alexwrodriguez.com/about/)*, co-founder of [Mirlo](https://mirlo.space/arod/releases), is also a writer, 
organizer, and trombonist working at the confluences of music and social 
transformation. His writing on the contemporary jazz world has appeared 
in The Newark Star-Ledger, NPR Music, LA Weekly, and DownBeat, among 
other outlets. Alex has also worked in the solidarity economy movement as 
 co-founder of the mental health worker cooperative, Catalyst Cooperative 
 Healing, as facilitator for the Sociocracy for All Cooperatives Circle, and as an Artist-Owner of Ampled.  Keeping up as a trombonist has always been an important part of this work, which has also brought wonderful opportunities to perform and teach throughout the Americas since his first gigs in Chile with Los Andes Big Band 20 years ago.

*[Sonia Erika]()*, co-founder of [Death Is A Business](https://mirlo.space/death-is-a-business) [bio and photo here]

To help them get there, we've set up this fundraiser page to invite donations to cover the costs for them and their bandmates to participate in Americanafest. We welcome donations of any size, and if you aren't able to contribute cash right now, please share the link with your networks. Thanks so much for your support!
